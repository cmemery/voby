# [Voby](https://voby.dev)

A high-performance framework with fine-grained observable-based reactivity for building rich applications.

## Features

This works similarly to [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com), but without the need for the Babel transform and with a different API.

- **No VDOM**: there's no VDOM overhead, the framework deals with raw DOM nodes directly.
- **No stale closures**: functions are always executed afresh, no need to worry about previous potential executions of the current function, ever.
- **No rules of hooks**: hooks are just regular functions, which you can nest indefinitely, call conditionally, use outside components, whatever you want.
- **No dependencies arrays**: the framework is able to detect what depends on what else automatically, no need to specify dependencies manually.
- **No props diffing**: updates are fine grained, there's no props diffing, whenever an attribute/property/class/handler/etc. should be updated it's updated directly and immediately.
- **No key prop**: you can just map over arrays, or use the `For` component with an array of unique values, no need to specify keys explicitly.
- **No Babel**: there's no need to use Babel with this framework, it works with plain old JS (plus JSX if you are into that). As a consequence we have 0 transform function bugs, because we don't have a transform function.
- **No magic**: what you see is what you get, your code is not transformed to actually do something different than what you write, there are no surprises.
- **No server support**: for the time being this framework is focused on local-first rich applications, ~no server-related features are implemented: no hydration, no server components, no SSR, no streaming etc.
- **Observable-based**: observables are at the core of our reactivity system. The way it works is very different from a React-like system, it may be more challenging to learn, but it's well worth the effort.
- **Work in progress**: this is probably beta software, I'm working on it because I need something with great performance for [Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable), I'm allergic to third-party dependencies, I'd like something with an API that resonates with me, and I wanted to deeply understand how the more solid [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com), which you should also check out, works.

## Usage

This framework is simply a view layer built on top of the Observable library [`oby`](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby), knowing how that works is necessary to understand how this works.

This framework basically re-exports everything that `oby` exports, sometimes with a slightly different interface, adjusted for usage as components or hooks, plus some additional functions.

The following is going to be a very shallow documentation of the API. As I mentioned this probably isn't production-grade software, it may become that in the future though, are you interested?

### Methods

The following top-level functions are provided.

#### `$`

This function is just the default export of `oby`, it can be used to wrap a value in an observable.

No additional methods are attached to this function. Everything that `oby` attaches to it is instead exported as components and hooks.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#core).

Interface:

```ts
function $ <T> (): Observable<T | undefined>;
function $ <T> ( value: undefined, options?: ObservableOptions<T | undefined> ): Observable<T | undefined>;
function $ <T> ( value: T, options?: ObservableOptions<T> ): Observable<T>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {$} from 'voby';

$ // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).default
```

#### `$$`

This function unwraps a potentially observable value.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#get).

Interface:

```ts
function $$ <T> ( value: T ): (T extends ObservableReadonly<infer U> ? U : T);
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {$$} from 'voby';

$$ // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).get
```

#### `createContext`

This function creates a context object, optionally with a default value, which can later be used to provide a new value for the context or to read the current value.

Interface:

```ts
type ContextConsumer<T> = ( props: { children: (( value?: T ) => JSX.Element) } ) => JSX.Element;
type ContextProvider<T> = ( props: { value: T, children: JSX.Element } ) => JSX.Element;
type Context<T> = { Consumer: ContextConsumer<T>, Provider: ContextProvider<T> };

function createContext <T> ( defaultValue?: T ): Context<T>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {createContext} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const Context = createContext ( 123 );
  return (
    <>
      <Context.Consumer>
        {value => <p>{value}</p>}
      </Context.Consumer>
      <Context.Provider value={312}>
        <Context.Consumer>
          {value => <p>{value}</p>}
        </Context.Consumer>
      </Context.Provider>
    </>
  );
};
```

#### `createElement`

This is the internal function that will make DOM nodes and call/instantiate components, it will be called for you automatically via JSX.

Interface:

```ts
function createElement <P = {}> ( component: JSX.Component<P>, props: P | null, ...children: JSX.Element[] ): () => JSX.Element);
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {createElement} from 'voby';

const element = createElement ( 'div', { class: 'foo' }, 'child' ); // => () => HTMLDivElement
```

#### `h`

This function is just an alias for the `createElement` function, it's more convenient to use if you want to use Voby in hyperscript mode just because it has a much shorter name.

Interface:

```ts
function h <P = {}> ( component: JSX.Component<P>, props: P | null, ...children: JSX.Element[] ): () => JSX.Element);
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {h} from 'voby';

const element = h ( 'div', { class: 'foo' }, 'child' ); // => () => HTMLDivElement
```

#### `isObservable`

This function tells you if a variable is an observable or not.

Interface:

```ts
function isObservable <T = unknown> ( value: unknown ): value is Observable<T> | ObservableReadonly<T>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {$, isObservable} from 'voby';

isObservable ( 123 ); // => false
isObservable ( $(123) ); // => true
```

#### `lazy`

This function creates a lazy component, which is loaded via the provided function only when/if needed.

This function uses `useResource` internally, so it's significant for `Suspense` too.

Interface:

```ts
type LazyComponent<P = {}> = ( props: P ) => ObservableReadonly<Child>;
type LazyFetcher<P = {}> = () => Promise<{ default: ComponentClass<P> | ComponentFunction<P> }>;
type LazyResult<P = {}> = LazyComponent<P> & ({ preload: () => Promise<void> });

function lazy <P = {}> ( fetcher: LazyFetcher<P> ): LazyResult<P>;
```

Usage:

```ts
import {lazy} from 'voby';

const LazyComponent = lazy ( () => import ( './Component' ) );
```

#### `render`

This function mounts a component inside a provided DOM element and returns a disposer function for unmounting it and stopping all reactivity inside it.

Interface:

```ts
function render ( child: JSX.Element, parent?: HTMLElement | null ): Disposer;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {render} from 'voby';

const App = () => <p>Hello, World!</p>;

const dispose = render ( <App />, document.body );

dispose (); // Unmounted and all reactivity inside it stopped
```

#### `renderToString`

This works just like `render`, but it returns a Promise to the HTML representation of the rendered component.

This is currently implemented in a way that works only inside a browser-like environement, so you'll need to use [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) or similar for this to work server-side, but it can work server-side too potentially.

This function automatically waits for all `Suspense` boundaries to resolve before returning.

Interface:

```ts
function renderToString ( child: JSX.Element ): Promise<string>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {renderToString} from 'voby';

const App = () => <p>Hello, World!</p>;

const html = await renderToString ( <App /> );
```

#### `resolve`

This function basically resolves any reactivity inside the passed argument, basically replacing every function it finds with a computed to the value of that function.

You may never need to use this function yourself, but it's necessary internally at times to make sure that a child value is properly tracked by its parent computation.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#resolve).

Interface:

```ts
type ResolvablePrimitive = null | undefined | boolean | number | bigint | string | symbol;
type ResolvableArray = Resolvable[];
type ResolvableObject = { [Key in string | number | symbol]?: Resolvable };
type ResolvableFunction = () => Resolvable;
type Resolvable = ResolvablePrimitive | ResolvableObject | ResolvableArray | ResolvableFunction;

function resolve <T> ( value: T ): T extends Resolvable ? T : never;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {resolve} from 'voby';

resolve // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).resolve
```

#### `template`

This function enables constructing elements with [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com)-level performance without using the Babel transform, but also without the convenience of that.

It basically works like [sinuous](https://github.com/luwes/sinuous/tree/master)'s template function, but with a cleaner API, since you don't have to access your props any differently inside the template here.

Basically you can use this to wrap a component that doesn't directly create any observables or call any hooks to significanly improve performance when instantiating that component.

Interface:

```ts
type TemplateOptions = { recycle?: boolean };

function template <P = {}> ( fn: (( props: P ) => JSX.Element), options: TemplateOptions = {} ): (( props: P ) => () => Element);
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {template} from 'voby';

const Row = template ( ({ id, cls, label, onSelect, onRemove }) => { // Now Row is super fast to instantiate
  return (
    <tr class={cls}>
      <td class="col-md-1">{id}</td>
      <td class="col-md-4">
        <a onClick={onSelect}>{label}</a>
      </td>
      <td class="col-md-1">
        <a onClick={onRemove}>
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove" ariaHidden={true}></span>
        </a>
      </td>
      <td class="col-md-6"></td>
    </tr>
  );
});

const Table = () => {
  const rows = [ /* props for all your rows here */ ];
  return rows.map ( row => <Row {...row}> );
};
```

### Components

The following components are provided.

Crucially some components are provided for control flow, since regular JavaScript control flow primitives are not reactive, and we need to have reactive alternatives to them to have great performance.

#### `Component`

This is the base class for your class-based components, if you are into that.

The nice thing about class-based components is that you get ref assignment for free, the eventual ref passed to a class component will automatically receive the class instance corresponding to the component. The class component itself doesn't even need to know about this, but automatically it is able to provide access to its public API to however asks for it.

Interface:

```ts
class Component<P = {}> {
  props: P;
  render ( props: P ): JSX.Element;
}
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {Component} from 'voby';

class App extends Component<{ value: number }> {
  render ( ({ value }) ): JSX.Element {
    return <p>Value: {value}</p>;
  }
};
```

#### `Dynamic`

This component is just an alternative to `createElement` that can be used in JSX, it's useful to create a new element dynamically.

Interface:

```ts
function Dynamic <P = {}> ( props: { component: ObservableMaybe<JSX.Component<P>, props?: ObservableMaybe<P | null>, children: JSX.Element }): JSX. Element;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {Dynamic} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const heading = 'h2';
  return (
    <Dynamic component={heading}>
      Some content
    </Dynamic>
  );
};
```

#### `ErrorBoundary`

The error boundary catches errors thrown inside it, and renders a fallback component when that happens.

Interface:

```ts
function ErrorBoundary ( props: { fallback: JSX.Element | (( props: { error: Error, reset: Disposer } ) => JSX.Element), children: JSX.Element }): ObservableReadonly<JSX.Element>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {ErrorBoundary} from 'voby';

const Fallback = ({ reset, error }: { reset: () => void, error: Error }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Error: {error.message}</p>
      <button onClick={error}>Recover</button>
    </>
  );
};

const SomeComponentThatThrows = () => {
  throw 'whatever';
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary fallback={Fallback}>
      <SomeComponentThatThrows />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
};
```

#### `For`

This component is the reactive alternative to natively mapping over an array.

It must be called with an array, or a function that returns an array, of _unique_ values, and each of them are passed to the child function to render something.

Interface:

```ts
function For <T> ( props: { values: FunctionMaybe<T[]>, fallback?: JSX.Element, children: (( value: T ) => JSX.Element) }): ObservableReadonly<JSX.Element>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {For} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  return (
    <For values={numbers}>
      {( value ) => {
        return <p>Value: {value}</p>
      }}
    </For>
  );
};
```

#### `Fragment`

This is just the internal component used for rendering fragments: `<></>`, you probably would never use this directly even if you are not using JSX, since you can return plain arrays from your components anyway.

Interface:

```ts
function Fragment ( props: { children: JSX.Element }): JSX.Element;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {Fragment} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <p>child 1</p>
      <p>child 2</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
```

#### `If`

This component is the reactive alternative to the native `if`.

Interface:

```ts
function If ( props: { when: FunctionMaybe<unknown>, fallback?: JSX.Element, children: JSX.Element }): ObservableReadonly<JSX.Element>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {If} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const visible = $(false);
  const toggle = () => visible ( !visible () );
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
      <If when={visible}>
        <p>Hello!</p>
      </If>
    </>
  );
};
```

#### `Portal`

This component mounts its children inside a provided DOM element, or inside `document.body` otherwise.

Events will propagate natively, according to the resulting DOM hierarchy, not the components hierarchy.

Interface:

```ts
function Portal ( props: { mount?: HTMLElement | null, children: JSX.Element }): (() => null) & ({ metadata: { portal: HTMLDivElement } });
```

Usage:

```tsx
import Portal from 'voby';

const Modal = () => {
  // Some modal component maybe...
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Portal mount={document.body}>
      <Modal />
    </Portal>
  );
};
```

#### `Suspense`

This component is like `If`, the reactive alternative to the native `if`, but both branches are kept alive under the hood at the same time, and the fallback branch is shown automatically while there are some resources loading in the main branch.

So this can be used to show some fallback content while the actual content is loading in the background.

This component relies on `useResource` to understand if there's a resource loading or not.

Interface:

```ts
function Suspense ( props: { fallback?: JSX.Element, children: JSX.Element }): ObservableReadonly<JSX.Element>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {Suspense} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const Content = () => {
    const resource = useResource ( () => makeSomePromise () );
    return (
      <Show when={() => !resource ().loading && !resource ().error}>
        {resource ().value}
      </Show>
    );
  };
  const Spinner = () => {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  };
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
      <Content />
    </Suspense>
  );
};
```

#### `Switch`

This component is the reactive alternative to the native `switch`.

Interface:

```ts
function Switch <T> ( props: { when: FunctionMaybe<T>, children: JSX.Element }): ObservableReadonly<JSX.Element>;

Switch.Case = function <T> ( props: { when: T, children: JSX.Element } ): (() => JSX.Element) & ({ metadata: [T, JSX.Element] });
Switch.Default = function ( props: { children: JSX.Element } ): (() => JSX.Element) & ({ metadata: [JSX.Element] });
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {Switch} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const value = $(0);
  const increment = () => value ( value () + 1 );
  const decrement = () => value ( value () - 1 );
  return (
    <>
      <Switch when={value}>
        <Switch.Case when={0}>
          <p>0, the boundary between positives and negatives! (?)</p>
        </Switch.Case>
        <Switch.Case when={1}>
          <p>1, the multiplicative identity!</p>
        </Switch.Case>
        <Switch.Default>
          <p>{value}, I don't have anything interesting to say about that :(</p>
        </Switch.Default>
      </Switch>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

#### `Ternary`

This component is the reactive alternative to the native ternary operator.

The first child will be rendered when the condition is truthy, otherwise the second child will be rendered.

Interface:

```ts
function Ternary ( props: { when: FunctionMaybe<unknown>, children: [JSX.Element, JSX.Element] } ): ObservableReadonly<JSX.Element>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {Ternary} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const visible = $(false);
  const toggle = () => visible ( !visible () );
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
      <Ternary when={visible}>
        <p>Visible :)</p>
        <p>Invisible :(</p>
      </Ternary>
    </>
  );
};
```

### Hooks

The following hooks are provided.

Many of these are just functions that `oby` provides, re-exported as `use*` functions, the rest are largely just alternatives to web built-ins that can also accept observables as arguments and can dispose of themselves automatically when the parent computation is disposed.

Hooks are just regular functions, if their name starts with `use` then we call them hooks just because.

#### `useAbortController`

This hook is just an alternative to `new AbortController ()` that automatically aborts itself when the parent computation is disposed.

Interface:

```ts
function useAbortController ( signals?: ArrayMaybe<AbortSignal> ): AbortController;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useAbortController} from 'voby';

const controller = useAbortController ();
```

#### `useAbortSignal`

This hook is just a convenient alternative to `useAbortController`, if you are only interested in its signal, which is automatically aborted when the parent computation is disposed.

Interface:

```ts
function useAbortSignal ( signals?: ArrayMaybe<AbortSignal> ): AbortSignal;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useAbortSignal} from 'voby';

const signal = useAbortSignal ();
```

function useAnimationFrame ( callback: ObservableMaybe<FrameRequestCallback> ): Disposer;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useAnimationFrame} from 'voby';

useAnimationFrame ( () => console.log ( 'called' ) );
```

#### `useAnimationLoop`

This hook is just a version of `useAnimationFrame` that loops until the parent computation is disposed.

Interface:

```ts
function useAnimationLoop ( callback: ObservableMaybe<FrameRequestCallback> ): Disposer;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useAnimationLoop} from 'voby';

useAnimationLoop ( () => console.log ( 'called' ) );
```

#### `useBatch`

This hook holds onto updates within its scope and flushes them out at once once it exits.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#batch).

Interface:

```ts
function useBatch <T> ( fn: () => T ): T;
function useBatch <T> ( value: T ): T;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useBatch} from 'voby';

useBatch // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).batch
```

#### `useCleanup`

This hook registers a function to be called when the parent computation is disposed.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#cleanup).

Interface:

```ts
function useCleanup ( fn: () => void ): void;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useCleanup} from 'voby';

useCleanup // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).cleanup
```

#### `useComputed`

This hook is the crucial other ingredient that we need, other than observables themselves, to have a powerful reactive system that can track dependencies and re-execute computations when needed.

This hook registers a function to be called when any of its dependencies change, and the return of that function is wrapped in a read-only observable and returned.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#computed).

Interface:

```ts
function useComputed <T> ( fn: () => T, options?: ObservableOptions<T | undefined> ): ObservableReadonly<T>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useComputed} from 'voby';

useComputed // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).computed
```

#### `useContext`

This hook retrieves the value out of a context object.

Interface:

```ts
function useContext <T> ( context: Context<T> ): T | undefined;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {createContext, useContext} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const ctx = createContext ( 123 );
  const value = useContext ( ctx );
  return <p>{value}</p>;
};
```

#### `useDisposed`

This hook returns a boolean read-only observable that is set to `true` when the parent computation gets disposed of.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#disposed).

Interface:

```ts
function useDisposed (): ObservableReadonly<boolean>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useDisposed} from 'voby';

useDisposed // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).disposed
```

#### `useEffect`

This hook registers a function to be called when any of its dependencies change. If a function is returned it's automatically registered as a cleanup function.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#effect).

Interface:

```ts
function useEffect ( fn: () => (() => void) | void ): (() => void);
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useEffect} from 'voby';

useEffect // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).effect
```

#### `useError`

This hook registers a function to be called when the parent computation throws.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#error).

Interface:

```ts
function useError ( fn: ( error: Error ) => void ): void;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useError} from 'voby';

useError // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).error
```

#### `useEventListener`

This hook is just an alternative to `addEventListener` that automatically clears itself when the parent computation is disposed.

Interface:

```ts
function useEventListener ( target: ObservableMaybe<EventTarget>, event: ObservableMaybe<string>, handler: ObservableMaybe<( event: Event ) => void>, options?: ObservableMaybe<true | AddEventListenerOptions> ): Disposer;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useEventListener} from 'voby';

useEventListener ( document, 'click', console.log );
```

#### `useFetch`

This hook wraps the output of a fetch request in an observable, so that you can be notified when it resolves or rejects. The request is also aborted automatically when the parent computation gets disposed of.

This hook uses `useResource` internally, so it's significant for `Suspense` too.

Interface:

```ts
function useFetch ( request: ObservableMaybe<RequestInfo>, init?: ObservableMaybe<RequestInit> ): ObservableReadonly<Resource<Response>>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useFetch} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const state = useFetch ( 'https://my.api' );
  return state.on ( state => {
    if ( state.loading ) return <p>loading...</p>;
    if ( state.error ) return <p>{state.error.message}</p>;
    return <p>Status: {state.value.status}</p>
  });
};
```

#### `useIdleCallback`

This hook is just an alternative to `requestIdleCallback` that automatically clears itself when the parent computation is disposed.

Interface:

```ts
function useIdleCallback ( callback: ObservableMaybe<IdleRequestCallback>, options?: ObservableMaybe<IdleRequestOptions> ): Disposer;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useIdleCallback} from 'voby';

useIdleCallback ( () => console.log ( 'called' ) );
```

#### `useIdleLoop`

This hook is just a version of `useIdleCallback` that loops until the parent computation is disposed.

Interface:

```ts
function useIdleLoop ( callback: ObservableMaybe<IdleRequestCallback>, options?: ObservableMaybe<IdleRequestOptions> ): Disposer;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useIdleLoop} from 'voby';

useIdleLoop ( () => console.log ( 'called' ) );
```

#### `useInterval`

This hook is just an alternative to `setInterval` that automatically clears itself when the parent computation is disposed.

Interface:

```ts
function useInterval ( callback: ObservableMaybe<Callback>, ms?: ObservableMaybe<number> ): Disposer;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useInterval} from 'voby';

useInterval ( () => console.log ( 'called' ), 1000 );
```

#### `useMicrotask`

This hook is just an alternative to `queueMicrotask` that automatically clears itself when the parent computation is disposed, and that ensures things like contexts, error boundaries etc. keep working inside the microtask.

Interface:

```ts
function useMicrotask ( fn: () => void ): void;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useMicrotask} from 'voby';

useMicrotask ( () => console.log ( 'called' ) );
```

#### `usePromise`

This hook wraps a promise in an observable, so that you can be notified when it resolves or rejects.

This hook uses `useResource` internally, so it's significant for `Suspense` too.

Interface:

```ts
function usePromise <T> ( promise: ObservableMaybe<Promise<T>> ): ObservableReadonly<Resource<T>>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {usePromise} from 'voby';

const App = () => {
  const request = fetch ( 'https://my.api' ).then ( res => res.json ( 0 ) );
  const promise = usePromise ( request );
  return resolved.on ( state => {
    if ( state.loading ) return <p>loading...</p>;
    if ( state.error ) return <p>{state.error.message}</p>;
    return <p>{JSON.stringify ( state.value )}</p>
  });
};
```

#### `useReadonly`

This hook creates a read-only observable out of another observable.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#readonly).

Interface:

```ts
function useReadonly <T> ( observable: Observable<T> | ObservableReadonly<T> ): ObservableReadonly<T>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useReadonly} from 'voby';

useReadonly // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).readonly
```

#### `useResolved`

This hook receives a value, or an array of values, potentially wrapped in functions and/or observables, and unwraps it/them.

If no callback is used then it returns the unwrapped value, otherwise it returns whatever the callback returns.

This is useful for handling reactive and non reactive values the same way. Usually if the value is a function, or always for convenience, you'd want to wrap the `useResolved` call in a `useComputed`, to maintain reactivity.

This is potentially a more convenient version of `$$`, made especially for handling nicely arguments passed that your hooks receive that may or may not be observables.

Interface:

> The precise interface for this function is insane, you can find it here: https://github.com/fabiospampinato/voby/blob/master/src/hooks/use_resolved.ts

Usage:

```tsx
import {$, useResolved} from 'voby';

useResolved ( 123 ); // => 123

useResolved ( $(123) ); // => 123

useResolved ( () => 123 ); // => () => 123

useResolved ( () => 123, true ); // => 123

useResolved ( $(123), value => 321 ); // => 321

useResolved ( [$(123), () => 123], ( a, b ) => 321, true ); // => 321
```

#### `useResource`

This hook wraps the result of a function call with an observable, handling the cases where the function throws, the result is an observable, the result is a promise or an observale that resolves to a promise, and the promise rejects, so that you don't have to worry about these issues.

This basically provides a unified way to handle sync and async results, observable and non observable results, and functions that throw and don't throw.

This function is also the mechanism through which `Suspense` understands if there are things loading under the hood or not.

Interface:

```ts
function useResource <T> ( fetcher: (() => ObservableMaybe<PromiseMaybe<T>>) ): ObservableReadonly<Resource<T>>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useResource} from 'voby';

const fetcher = () => fetch ( 'https://my.api' );

const resource = useResource ( fetcher );
```

#### `useRoot`

This hook creates a new computation root, detached from any parent computation.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#root).

Interface:

```ts
function useRoot <T> ( fn: ( dispose: () => void ) => T ): T;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useRoot} from 'voby';

useRoot // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).root
```

#### `useSample`

This hook executes the provided function without creating dependencies on observables retrieved inside it.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#sample).

Interface:

```ts
function useSample <T> ( fn: () => T ): T;
function useSample <T> ( value: T ): T;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useSample} from 'voby';

useSample // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).sample
```

#### `useSelector`

This hook massively optimizes `isSelected` kind of workloads.

[Read upstream documentation](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/oby#selector).

Interface:

```ts
function useSelector <T> ( observable: Observable<T> | ObservableReadonly<T> ): (( value: T ) => boolean);
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useSelector} from 'voby';

useSelector // => Same as require ( 'oby' ).selector
```

#### `useTimeout`

This hook is just an alternative to `setTimeout` that automatically clears itself when the parent computation is disposed.

Interface:

```ts
function useTimeout ( callback: ObservableMaybe<Callback>, ms?: ObservableMaybe<number> ): Disposer;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import {useTimeout} from 'voby';

useTimeout ( () => console.log ( 'called' ), 1000 );
```

### Types

#### `FunctionMaybe`

This type says that something can be the value itself or a function that returns that value.

It's useful at times since some components, like `If`, accept `when` conditions wrapped in `FunctionMaybe`.

Interface:

```ts
type FunctionMaybe<T> = (() => T) | T;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import type {FunctionMaybe} from 'voby';

const SomeConditionalComponent = ( when: FunctionMaybe<boolean>, value: string ): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <If when={when}>
      {value}
    </If>
  );
};
```

#### `Observable`

This type says that something is a regular observable, which can be updated via its setter.

Interface:

```ts
type Observable<T> = {
  (): T,
  ( value: T ): T,
  ( fn: ( value: T ) => T ): T
};
```

Usage:

```tsx
import type {Observable} from 'voby';

const fn = ( value: Observable<boolean> ): void => {
  value (); // Getting
  value ( true ); // Setting
};
```

#### `ObservableReadonly`

This type says that something is a read-only observable, which can only be read but not updated.

Interface:

```ts
type ObservableReadonly<T> = {
  (): T
};
```

Usage:

```tsx
import type {ObservableReadonly} from 'voby';

const fn = ( value: ObservableReadonly<boolean> ): void => {
  value (); // Getting
  value ( true ); // This will throw!
};
```

#### `ObservableMaybe`

This type says that something can be the value itself or an observable to that value.

This is super useful if you want to write components and hooks that can accept either plain values or observables to those values.

Interface:

```ts
type ObservableMaybe<T> = Observable<T> | ObservableReadonly<T> | T;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import type {ObservableMaybe} from 'voby';

const Button = ({ label }: { label: ObservableMaybe<string> }): JSX.Element => {
  return <button>{label}</button>;
};
```

#### `ObservableOptions`

This type describes the options object that various functions can accept to tweak how the underlying observable works.

Interface:

```ts
type ObservableOptions<T> = {
  equals?: (( value: T, valuePrev: T ) => boolean) | false
};
```

Usage:

```tsx
import type {Observable, ObservableOptions} from 'voby';
import {$} from 'voby';

const createTimestamp = ( options?: ObservableOptions ): Observable<number> => {
  return $( Date.now (), options );
};
```

#### `Resource`

This is the type of object that `useResource`, `usePromise` and `useFetch` will return you.

It's an object that tells if whether the resource is loading or not, whether an error happened or not, if what the eventual resulting value is.

Interface:

```ts
type ResourceLoading = { loading: true, error?: never, value?: never };
type ResourceRejected = { loading: false, error: Error, value?: never };
type ResourceResolved<T> = { loading: false, error?: never, value: T };
type Resource<T> = ResourceLoading | ResourceRejected | ResourceResolved<T>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import type {ObservableReadonly, Resource} from 'voby';

const resource: ObservableReadonly<Resource> = useResource ( () => fetch ( 'https://my.api' ) );

resource ().loading // => true | false
resource ().error // => Error | undefined
resource ().value // => Whatever the resource will resolve to
```

#### `F`

This type is just a convenient alias for `FunctionMaybe`, because typing `FunctionMaybe` a lot can be annoying.

Interface:

```ts
type F<T> = FunctionMaybe<T>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import type {F} from 'voby';

const SomeConditionalComponent = ( when: F<boolean>, value: string ): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <If when={when}>
      {value}
    </If>
  );
};
```

#### `O`

This type is just a convenient alias for `ObservableMaybe`, because typing `ObservableMaybe` a lot can be annoying.

Interface:

```ts
type O<T> = ObservableMaybe<T>;
```

Usage:

```tsx
import type {O} from 'voby';

const Button = ({ label }: { label: O<string> }): JSX.Element => {
  return <button>{label}</button>;
};
```

### Extras

Extra features and details.

#### `JSX`

JSX is supported out of the box, as a rule of thumb it's very similar to how React's JSX works, but with some differences.

- The value provided to an attribute can always be either just the plain value itself, an observable to that value, or a function to that value. If an observable or a function is provided then that attribute will update itself in a fine-grained manner.
- There's no "key" attribute because it's unnecessary.
- Only refs in the function form are supported, so you are incentivized to simply use observables for them too.
- A ref function attached to a DOM element will also be called with `undefined` when that node is unmounted.
- The "ref" attribute can also accept an array of functions to call, for convenience.
- You can simply just use "class" instead of "className".
- The "class" attribute can also accept an object of classes, for convenience.
- SVGs are supported out of the box and will also be updated in a fine-grained manner.
- The "innerHTML", "outerHTML" and "textContent" attributes are forbidden, as they are largely just footguns.
- A React-like "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" attribute is supported for setting some raw HTML.
- Numbers set as values for style properties that require a unit to be provided will automatically be suffixed with "px".
- Using CSS variables in the "style" object is supported out of the box.
- The following events are delegated, automatically: `beforeinput`, `click`, `dblclick`, `focusin`, `focusout`, `input`, `keydown`, `keyup`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`.
- Events always bubble according to the natural DOM hierarchy, there's no special bubbling logic for `Portal`.
- Class components, but with no lifecycle callbacks, are supported too. They got thrown away with the bath water by other frameworks, but organizing internal methods in a class and assigning that class to refs automatically is actually a really nice feature.

#### `Tree Shaking`

Voby is released as a tree-shakeable ESM module. The functions you don't use simply won't be included in the final bundle.

#### `TypeScript`

There are two main actions needed to make Voby work with TypeScript.

1. Voby is an ESM-only framework, so you _might_ need to mark your package as ESM too in order to use it, you can do that by putting the following in your `package.json`:
   ```
   "type": "module"
   ```
2. You should instruct TypeScript to load the correct JSX types by putting the following in your `tsconfig.json`:
   ```
   "jsx": "preserve",
   "jsxImportSource": "voby",
   ```
3. Optionally, if you don't want to use a bundler or if you are using a bundler for which a plugin hasn't been written yet you can just define a "React" variable in scope and just use the JSX transform for React:
   ```ts
   import * as React from 'voby';
   ```
